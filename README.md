### About Me
* My name is Tom. I am a driven, results-oriented Junior Data Scientist with a recent background in hospitality management. My 
 transition into data science stems from a passion for applying analytical insights to solve real-world problems. I recently graduated from the HyperionDev Data Science bootcamp with top marks, demonstrating my solid foundation in Python, SQL, data analysis, visualization, and machine learning techniques.
* My hospitality experience honed my adaptability, client-focused mindset, and ability to thrive in dynamic environments.
 These skills, combined with my analytical capabilities, position me to make valuable contributions to data-driven teams.
 I'm particularly interested in the intersection of data science and NLP, as seen in my projects like the NHS chatbot and product review sentiment analysis.
